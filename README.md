BeatBox v2
===========

How to use
===========
The compiled files are kept in the classes directory. While the source is kept in the src directory. To execute the application follow the steps:

1. Open command prompt, navigate to the classes directory and enter the command "java BeatBoxV1"
2. Alternatively, navigate to the src directory and enter the command:
	a. "javac BeatBoxV2_3.java"
	b. "java BeatBoxV2_3"
3. Or on a windows machine, just launch the 'start.bat' file and wait for the program to run.
